Hello There!

My name is Brook, and I am a graduate student in the Masters of Geomatics for Environmental Management (MGEM) program's class of 2025. Originally from Ethiopia, Canada has been my home for the past seven years, where I enjoyed traveling, exploring the outdoors and the multicultural community and food scene. I am pursuing the MGEM to deepen my understanding of geomatics concepts and tools, develop new technical and analytically skills, and enhance my qualifications for a career in environmental and resource management. My professional aspiration is to work in an organization where I can leverage both technical and soft skills to tackle resource management challenges and promote sustainability. I am particularly passionate about using my expertise to address challenges in emerging economies.
