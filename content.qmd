### **Monitoring Mangrove Restoration Using Sentinel - 2 Imagery**

As the capstone project of my Master's program in Geomatics for Environmental Management (MGEM), this project is a significant culmination of my academic journey. For my project, I collaborated with [**Blue Ventures**](https://blueventures.org/what-we-do/), a marine conservation organization focused on coastal ecosystem restoration, to study their mangrove restoration efforts in the Bay of Assassins, Madagascar. Using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and [**GEM**](https://blueventures.org/what-we-do/climate-solutions/blue-forests/gem/), a Google Earth Engine based tool, I mapped mangrove forests from 2019 to 2024, measuring changes in forest area and vegetation health.

My study investigates the question: **To what extent can Sentinel-2 imagery detect changes in mangrove forest area and health at restoration sites in Madagascar?** I answer this by quantifying mangrove vegetation changes, identifying areas of growth and loss, and assess vegetation health overtime. The focus on mangroves in restoration areas supports Blue Ventures’ mission to protect and restore mangroves in the region.

**Methods & Tools:**

-   **Data**: Sentinel-2 satellite imagery (2019–2024), Mangrove Restoration sites in Madagascar

-   **Tools**: Google Earth Engine (GEM v2) for time-series analysis, QGIS & ArcGIS Pro for mapping and visualizations

-   **Analysis**:

    -   Quantify changes in mangrove extent over time.

    -   Identify areas of significant growth and loss.

    -   Assess vegetation health using spectral indices (NDVI,).

My full report will be available here once the project ends, but I've summarized and visualized some of my results below.

### **Using Python for Geo-spatial Analysis**

For this project, I applied three geo-processing techniques, intersect, buffer, and area calculation, to my capstone research on mangrove ecosystems. Using Python, I intersected my study area with the Global Mangrove Watch data set, applied a 25-meter buffer to the mangroves, and calculated their total area. I also automated data acquisition by scripting a download process for the datasets.

**Methods with Code Snippets:**

The first steps was to download data friom the Global Mangrove Watch online database. Next came Click on the headings below to see my code the automated downloading and extraction of Global Mangrove Watch data.

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}
## Automated Downloading of Mangrove Data

``` (.python)
import requests
import zipfile
url = "https://zenodo.org/records/6894273/files/gmw_v3_2020_vec.zip?download=1"

#Fetching and downloading the data
data = requests.get(url)

#saving data to a file
with open('boa_mangrove_data.zip', 'wb') as file:
    file.write(data.content)
print("Download Completed Successfully")

#Extracting data from ZIP file and saving in data folder
zip_file_path = 'boa_mangrove_data.zip'
extract_file = 'data_' # Data folder where I want to save the extracted contents

# Opening the ZIP file
with zipfile.ZipFile(zip_file_path, 'r') as zip_ref:
    zip_ref.extractall(extract_file)

print(f'Contents extracted to: {extract_file}')
```

## Geo-Processing Steps

``` (.python)
# Using Intersect to extract mangroves in AOI from Global Mangrove Watch (GMW) Data
arcpy.analysis.Intersect(['gmw_v3_2020_vec.shp',
                          'TAHIRY_HONKO_MANAGEMENT_AREA.shp'], 
                          "boa_mangroves.shp", "ALL") 
print('Mangroves clipped successfully.')

# Creating the 25 meter buffer for mangroves
boa_buffer = arcpy.analysis.Buffer(in_features='boa_mangroves.shp',     
                                  out_feature_class='boa_buffer.shp', 
                                  buffer_distance_or_field='25 meters',   
                                  dissolve_option="ALL")
print('Buffer created successfully.')

# Calculating Total Area of Mangroves
mangrove_areas = list() #Creating an empty list to store output of Search Cursor

with arcpy.da.SearchCursor("boa_mangroves.shp", ["Shape_Area"]) as cursor:
  for row in cursor:
      mangrove_areas.append(row[0]) #adding results from Shape_Area into list
total_area = sum(mangrove_areas) * 100 #converting area from Square Km to ha
print("Total Mangrove Area (ha):",total_area,"ha")
del cursor
del row
```

### **Investigating Movement Corridors for Grizzly Bears in Alberta**

For this assignment, I performed a **Least Cost Path** analysis in ArcGIS Pro to evaluate optimal routes between a source and target location, considering environmental factors like terrain, land cover, and roads. The goal was to determine the most efficient path for a grizzly bear when travelling through a landscape. I did this by calculating a cost raster, which incorporates the obstacles associated with moving through an area, such as uneven slopes, proximity to roads, and changing land cover.

**Key Results:**\
The analysis provided the optimal route based on minimized movement costs and highlighted the impact of terrain and land cover on accessibility in a habitat.

**Reflection:**\
This assignment deepened my interest in species conservation by giving me a glimpse into how conservationists study the impacts of human development on endangered species. Through spatial analysis, I saw firsthand how movement corridors are shaped by habitat fragmentation and how crucial it is to consider these dynamics when planning development. Mapping least-cost paths made me feel like a conservationist myself, applying real-world methods to assess connectivity and identify risks to wildlife. It reinforced my appreciation for this type of work and made me envision the possibility of contributing to similar studies in the future.

**Skills Gained:**

-   Least Cost Path Analysis (ArcGIS Pro)

-   Cost Raster Creation (Terrain, Land Cover, Roads)

-   Spatial Analysis for Species Conservation

-   Impact of Habitat Fragmentation on Species Movement

### **LiDAR Data Processing: From Basics to Tree Segmentation**

I first encountered LiDAR data during our graduate program orientation, where I was blown away by 3D visualizations created captured from a drone flight. This moment sparked my excitement to dive into the world of LiDAR and explore its potential in forestry.

#### **Task 1: Getting Hands-On with LiDAR Basics**

In this assignment, I learned how to process LiDAR data in R to create a Canopy Height Model (CHM), or as I like to call it, "tree height map." The goal was to familiarize myself with handling .las files, working with multiple tiles, and extracting point clouds from specific forest plots. I generated digital elevation models (DEMs) and CHMs to visualize tree heights and analyzed plot-level metrics to describe vegetation structure. It was a great introduction to organizing data, normalizing point clouds, and creating useful forestry products.

Results of CHMs

#### **Task 2: Individual Tree Segmentation**

The second assignment took me to the next level, where I worked with LiDAR data from the Malcolm Knapp Research Forest to identify individual trees. Using the [lidR](https://r-lidar.github.io/lidRbook/) package in R, I compared algorithms for tree detection by analyzing point clouds and CHMs. I fine-tuned parameters to improve results and deepened my understanding of segmentation methods through practical questions.

#### **Reflection:**

It’s incredible to see how quickly I progressed from a curious observer to someone who can process and segment LiDAR data with confidence. Each step, from mapping terrain to identifying individual trees, has expanded my understanding of LiDAR’s potential in forestry. I'm excited to continue exploring this technology's applications in environmental monitoring.

#### **Skills Gained:**

-   LiDAR Data Processing

-   Canopy Height Model (CHM) Creation

-   Point Cloud Classification

-   Tree Segmentation

-   Algorithm Comparison

-   R Programming (lidR package)

### **Modeling Forest Landscape Changes with Markov Models**

As part of my Landscape Ecology course, I explored Markov models, a tool widely used in landscape ecology to predict future land cover changes based on past transitions. One of our labs focused on modeling landscape changes in the Pacific Northwestern forests using a Markov model. By analyzing Landsat imagery data from 1972, 1984, and 1991, we classified forest cover into different age classes and calculated transition probabilities for these classes over time. The Markov model was then used to:

-   Project future forest composition under different management scenarios.

-   Evaluate the impact of reduced harvesting rates on forest cover types.

-   Assess the long-term sustainability of current forest management practices.

One key aspect of this project involved simulating **landscape changes over 1000 years**, as seen in my figure below, to examine how forest cover proportions would stabilize under different harvesting scenarios.

![Simulating Longterm Transition of Forest of different age classes](images/Markov_Model_plot.png){fig-align="center" width="588"}

#### Key Findings

-   **Longer timesteps improve accuracy** – The **1972–1984 projection** was more reliable than **1984–1991**, likely due to the longer timeframe capturing more stable trends.

-   **Harvest rates impact old-growth forests** – Reducing harvest rates slowed forest loss and increased the proportion of mature forests over time.

-   **Sustainability concerns** – The **1972–1984 harvesting rates led to a significant decline in old-growth forests**, with their proportion falling below 20%, indicating unsustainable practices.

-   **Steady-state conditions** – Over time, the model projected that mature forests would **stabilize above 30%**, but this depended on continued reductions in harvest rates.

**Reflection:**

This project reinforced the well-known quote: “All models are wrong, but some are useful.” The goal was not to produce perfectly accurate predictions but rather to explore how different management decisions influence long-term forest dynamics. By adjusting harvest rates and observing their effects, I could see how even small policy changes significantly alter the landscape over time. This experience served as an important reminder that models should not be taken at face value—they are simplifications of reality and should always be interpreted with caution. The real power of models lies in their ability to help explore scenarios, test assumptions, and guide better decision-making rather than provide absolute answers.

**Skills Gained:**

-   Markov modeling

-   Impact Evaluation

-   Interpreting model outputs

### **Exploring Urban Expansion in the Kitchener-Waterloo Region: My First Project**

Reflecting on this project always brings me back to the early days of my remote sensing journey. It was during my undergraduate years, when I first introduced to the field of geomatics, and intrigued by the idea of examining the world from a distance and without physical contact a.k.a "remote sensing". This project marked the beginning of my journey in remote sensing and how satellite imagery can reveal changes in the world over time.

#### **Overview:**

For this project, I used Landsat images from 1990 to 2020 to visualize and quantify how urban land cover had changed over the 30-year period. I used an ISODATA unsupervised classification algorithm to categorize the images into four land cover classes: vegetation, water, built-up areas, and barren cropland. I then performed a bi-temporal change detection analysis to identify urban expansion. The results revealed a 16.5% increase in the urban landscape, mostly replacing barren cropland. This urban sprawl was driven by rapid population growth, and the spatial pattern was scattered, emphasizing the need for monitoring urban growth to reduce its environmental impact.

#### **Results:**

#### **Reflection:**

Looking at this project now, I can’t help but reflect on how much I’ve grown in the remote sensing field. At the time, I was just starting to understand the process, working with image classification but without any coding. Today, I’m able to tackle much more complex analyses and understand the underlying principles more deeply.

#### **Skills Gained:**

-   Image Classification

-   Change Detection Analysis

-   Geo-spatial Analysis

-   Report Writing
