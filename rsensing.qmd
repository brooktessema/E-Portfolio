### **Monitoring Mangrove Restoration Using Sentinel - 2 Imagery**

As the capstone project of my Master's program in Geomatics for Environmental Management (MGEM), this project is a significant culmination of my academic journey. For my project, I collaborated with [**Blue Ventures**](https://blueventures.org/what-we-do/), a marine conservation organization focused on coastal ecosystem restoration, to study their mangrove restoration efforts in the Bay of Assassins, Madagascar. Using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and [**GEM**](https://blueventures.org/what-we-do/climate-solutions/blue-forests/gem/), a Google Earth Engine based tool, I mapped mangrove forests from 2019 to 2024, measuring changes in forest area and vegetation health.

My study investigates the question: **To what extent can Sentinel-2 imagery detect changes in mangrove forest area and health at restoration sites in Madagascar?** I answer this by quantifying mangrove vegetation changes, identifying areas of growth and loss, and assess vegetation health overtime. The focus on mangroves in restoration areas supports Blue Ventures’ mission to protect and restore mangroves in the region.

#### **Tools & Methods:**

-   **Data**: Sentinel-2 satellite imagery (2019–2024), Mangrove Restoration sites in Madagascar

-   **Tools**: Google Earth Engine (GEM v2) for time-series analysis, QGIS & ArcGIS Pro for mapping and visualizations

-   **Analysis**:

    -   Quantify changes in mangrove extent over time.

    -   Identify areas of significant growth and loss.

    -   Assess vegetation health using spectral indices (NDVI,).

My full report will be available here once the project ends, but I've summarized and visualized some of my results below.

### **Using Python for Geo-spatial Analysis**

For this project, I applied three geo-processing techniques, intersect, buffer, and area calculation, to my capstone research on mangrove ecosystems. Using Python, I intersected my study area with the Global Mangrove Watch data set, applied a 25-meter buffer to the mangroves, and calculated their total area. I also automated data acquisition by scripting a download process for the datasets.

#### **Methods with Code Snippets:**

The first steps was to download data friom the Global Mangrove Watch online database. Next came Click on the headings below to see my code the automated downloading and extraction of Global Mangrove Watch data.

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}
## Automated Downloading of Mangrove Data

``` (.python)
import requests
import zipfile
url = "https://zenodo.org/records/6894273/files/gmw_v3_2020_vec.zip?download=1"

#Fetching and downloading the data
data = requests.get(url)

#saving data to a file
with open('boa_mangrove_data.zip', 'wb') as file:
    file.write(data.content)
print("Download Completed Successfully")

#Extracting data from ZIP file and saving in data folder
zip_file_path = 'boa_mangrove_data.zip'
extract_file = 'data_' # Data folder where I want to save the extracted contents

# Opening the ZIP file
with zipfile.ZipFile(zip_file_path, 'r') as zip_ref:
    zip_ref.extractall(extract_file)

print(f'Contents extracted to: {extract_file}')
```

## Geo-Processing Steps

``` (.python)
# Using Intersect to extract mangroves in AOI from Global Mangrove Watch (GMW) Data
arcpy.analysis.Intersect(['gmw_v3_2020_vec.shp',
                          'TAHIRY_HONKO_MANAGEMENT_AREA.shp'], 
                          "boa_mangroves.shp", "ALL") 
print('Mangroves clipped successfully.')

# Creating the 25 meter buffer for mangroves
boa_buffer = arcpy.analysis.Buffer(in_features='boa_mangroves.shp',     
                                  out_feature_class='boa_buffer.shp', 
                                  buffer_distance_or_field='25 meters',   
                                  dissolve_option="ALL")
print('Buffer created successfully.')

# Calculating Total Area of Mangroves
mangrove_areas = list() #Creating an empty list to store output of Search Cursor

with arcpy.da.SearchCursor("boa_mangroves.shp", ["Shape_Area"]) as cursor:
  for row in cursor:
      mangrove_areas.append(row[0]) #adding results from Shape_Area into list
total_area = sum(mangrove_areas) * 100 #converting area from Square Km to ha
print("Total Mangrove Area (ha):",total_area,"ha")
del cursor
del row
```

### **LiDAR Data Processing: From Basics to Tree Segmentation**

I first encountered LiDAR data during our graduate program orientation, where I was blown away by 3D visualizations created captured from a drone flight. This moment sparked my excitement to dive into the world of LiDAR and explore its potential in forestry.

#### **Task 1: Getting Hands-On with LiDAR Basics**

In this assignment, I learned how to process LiDAR data in R to create a Canopy Height Model (CHM), or as I like to call it, "tree height map." The goal was to familiarize myself with handling .las files, working with multiple tiles, and extracting point clouds from specific forest plots. I generated digital elevation models (DEMs) and CHMs to visualize tree heights and analyzed plot-level metrics to describe vegetation structure. It was a great introduction to organizing data, normalizing point clouds, and creating useful forestry products.

Results of CHMs

#### **Task 2: Individual Tree Segmentation**

The second assignment took me to the next level, where I worked with LiDAR data from the Malcolm Knapp Research Forest to identify individual trees. Using the [lidR](https://r-lidar.github.io/lidRbook/) package in R, I compared algorithms for tree detection by analyzing point clouds and CHMs. I fine-tuned parameters to improve results and deepened my understanding of segmentation methods through practical questions.

#### **Reflection:**

It’s incredible to see how quickly I progressed from a curious observer to someone who can process and segment LiDAR data with confidence. Each step, from mapping terrain to identifying individual trees, has expanded my understanding of LiDAR’s potential in forestry. I'm excited to continue exploring this technology's applications in environmental monitoring.

#### **Skills Gained:**

### **Exploring Urban Expansion in the Kitchener-Waterloo Region: My First Project**

Reflecting on this project always brings me back to the early days of my remote sensing journey. It was during my undergraduate years, when I first introduced to the field of geomatics, and intrigued by the idea of examining the world from a distance and without physical contact a.k.a "remote sensing". This project marked the beginning of my journey in remote sensing and how satellite imagery can reveal changes in the world over time.

#### **Overview:**

For this project, I used Landsat images from 1990 to 2020 to visualize and quantify how urban land cover had changed over the 30-year period. I used an ISODATA unsupervised classification algorithm to categorize the images into four land cover classes: vegetation, water, built-up areas, and barren cropland. I then performed a bi-temporal change detection analysis to identify urban expansion. The results revealed a 16.5% increase in the urban landscape, mostly replacing barren cropland. This urban sprawl was driven by rapid population growth, and the spatial pattern was scattered, emphasizing the need for monitoring urban growth to reduce its environmental impact.

#### **Results:**

#### **Reflection:**

Looking at this project now, I can’t help but reflect on how much I’ve grown in the remote sensing field. At the time, I was just starting to understand the process, working with image classification but without any coding. Today, I’m able to tackle much more complex analyses and understand the underlying principles more deeply.

#### **Skills Gained:**

-   Image Classification

-   Change Detection Analysis

-   Geo-spatial Analysis

-   Report Writing
